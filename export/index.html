                    Much like a typical web page, an HTML email has standards and best practices that should be followed. However, much unlike a typical web page, how and where the emails we build are far from standard. Many email clients have specific technical limitations which, depending on your audience, will influence the way you structure your layout and HTML.

                    This guide will recommend best practices to ensure your email delivers an engaging message through a positive user experience and has the best chance to render correctly across all email clients, operating systems and devices.

                <h1 class="heading heading--medium ">Content Hierarchy</h1>
                <p>
                    How you prioritize your content is just as important as the message itself. What content is the most important? Should the begining of the email hook the reader to scroll and keep reading? Or should you include your primary action at the very beginning? How should you style different pieces of text to show emphasis? These are all questions relating to content hierarchy.

                <h2 class="heading heading--small ">The preview pane</h2>
                <p>
                    Most desktop clients utilize a small window to show a portion of the email on first load. This window is commonly referred to as the preview pane. It’s important to consider that although you are designing for a large screen, many readers will only see the beginning of your email. Consider designing your most interesting and engaging content higher into your email.
