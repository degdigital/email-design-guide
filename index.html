                        Much like a typical web page, an HTML email has standards and best practices that should be followed. However, much unlike a typical web page, how and where the emails we build are far from standard. Many email clients have specific technical limitations which, depending on your audience, will influence the way you structure your layout and HTML.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This guide will recommend best practices to ensure your email delivers an engaging message through a positive user experience and has the best chance to render correctly across all email clients, operating systems and devices.

                    <p>
                        Most desktop clients utilize a small window to show a portion of the email on first load. This window is commonly referred to as the preview pane. It’s important to consider that although you are designing for a large screen, many readers will only see the beginning of your email. Consider designing your most interesting and engaging content higher in your email.

                    <h1 class="heading heading--medium ">Content Hierarchy</h1>
                    <p>
                        How you prioritize your content is just as important as the message itself. What content is the most important? Should the begining of the email hook the reader to scroll and keep reading? Or should you include your primary action at the very beginning? How should you style different pieces of text to show emphasis? These are all questions relating to content hierarchy.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="heading heading--small ">Link depth</h2>
                    <p>
                        Studies show that the deeper a link (i.e. the further one must read until they see it), the less clicks it will receive across all devices. The fifth link in an email typically gets half as many clicks as the first link. Studies also show that highly engaging content can prove this to be untrue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bottom line is that successful emails have a good balance between content and the primary action. If you want to tell an engaging story, it would be appropriate to place your primary action lower in your email. If you want to user to click on an external above all else, you should place that link higher in your email.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="heading heading--small ">Primary vs Supplemental CTAs</h2>
                    <p>
                        It’s important to remember that some links are more important than others and should be designed accordingly. Certain links are primary actions and should be styled bold, like a button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Buttons are hard to miss - even at a glance. That being said - don’t go overboard! Buttons should be used to call attention to the primary message - not littered throughout the email.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Sign up now”, “Add to cart” and “Become a member” are all examples of primary actions. A primary action is what you want the user to do, or in other words, the entire reason the email was sent in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have a link that isn’t related to the primary action, then it’s a secondary action. Secondary actions are used to provide supplemental content, or display non-crucial actions. Primary and secondary action links should be visually distinct. By styling secondary actions this way, the audience will be able to read the email content undistracted. Readers should be able to read through a secondary action link without being visually distracted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Learn more before you sign up” “view product details” and “view member benefits” are all examples of a non-crucial actions. (These correspond with the primary action examples above.)

                    <p>
                        Similar to how a book has chapters, your email should have clearly defined sections. This can be achieved in various ways, including, but not limited to: dividing lines, background colors and bold headings. Each section of content should also have a clear, easy-to-read and well-written header. You can have great content, but if the heading isn’t captivating or visual appealing it could be bypassed.

                    <p>
                        The number of nav items that should be included in an email is dependant on a few different factors including, but not limited to: the type of email being sent (i.e. - retail, trigger, transactional, newsletter, etc), the needs of the brand, whether or not dynamic content is being displayed based on audience preferences, and the percentage of mobile audience.

                    <p>
                        Typography is the one thing that is rendered consistently across all email clients. Some clients block images by default, so often times typography is the only thing a reader sees on first load.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="heading heading--small ">Selecting Fonts</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sticking with common cross-platform fonts for email is the easiest way to ensure consistent rendering across clients. When defining fonts, always include a full font stack by declaring fallbacks in your CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if you want to use Helvetica Neue, you would do so with: ‘font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, arial, sans-serif;’. Defining fallbacks ensures that even if a subscriber doesn’t have Helvetica Neue on their system, the email will still be rendered with a comparable font. In this case, helvetica, arial or the systems default sans-serif font.

                    <h2 class="heading heading--small ">Using Custom Brand Fonts</h2>
                    <p>
                        A custom font, also called a web font, is as it sounds: a non-standard, custom brand font. Custom fonts increase creative options for designers and brand identity, however they are very experimental in HTML email and implementation will present some unique challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For starters, it’s important to have an approximate fallback font defined. This fallback font will render if a subscriber opens your email on a client that doesn’t support web fonts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the time the fallback font will render at varied heights and/or widths than the custom font. This fallback must be tested so that the email doesn’t break in the clients using it.
                    </p>

                        <div class="image-callout__wrapper">
                            <img class="image-callout__hero" src="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;placehold.it&#x2F;680x355" alt="Image Alt Text">
                        </div>
                    </figure>
                    <h2 class="heading heading--small ">Faking Custom Brand Fonts</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you are using a custom brand font for small areas of static text like section headers, and you don’t want to use a fallback font, consider saving out the text as an image. This will give the appearance of a custom font, even in clients that lack support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, do not use this technique for large areas of text or text that needs to be changed regularly. Due to the nature of images in email, as well as the constraints of images in responsive design, this technique is only recommended when there is no other alternative and should be used with caution.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="topic-section" id="images">
                <header class="topic-section__header" style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(133, 218, 223, .7), rgba(133, 218, 223, .7)), url('images/pattern.svg'), url('images&#x2F;mobile.jpg');">
                    <h1 class="wrapper wrapper--small heading heading--large-alt topic-section__heading">Images</h1>
                </header>
                <div class="wrapper wrapper--small main-content">
                    <h1 class="heading heading--medium ">[IMAGES]</h1>
                    <p>
                        It’s never a good idea to send an email comprised solely of images. Emails built this way can look spammy and unnecessarily increase the file size of the email. Always strive for a good image to text ratio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, <a href="#">43% of your subscribers are likely to have images off by default</a>. This is why it’s recommended to always include important information as text. Doing so ensures the primary message is still visible when images are disabled.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="heading heading--small ">Designing with Background Images</h2>
                    <p>
                        Often times a designer will want to put text on top of a image. For the reasons above it’s recommended to use a background image instead of including the text inside the image. Background images in email are tricky, but completely possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only advanced clients like Apple Mail and a few mobile clients support advanced CSS background declarations like position or repeat. Because of this, it’s best to assume the background image will appear repeated on both the X and Y axis and be left aligned. Designing for these default behaviors will reduce frustration when working with background images.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="heading heading--small ">CSS Instead of Images when Possible</h2>
                    <p>
                        Using CSS in place of images, when possible, will dramatically reduce the file size of your email and decrease load times. Borders, gradients, drop shadows and rounded corners are all possible through CSS. If you’re of unsure of what CSS is supported in different clients, Campaign Monitor has a very handy CSS compatibility chart you can reference.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="heading heading--small ">Images as Touch Targets</h2>
                    <p>
                        It’s a good idea to make images clickable, so long as the outbound link is relevant. Linked images provide readers a more visual way to navigate email. It’s also much easier to tap an image on mobile than text. Always evaluate touch targets for possible interference errors. If small targets are too close together, adjust their size and spacing.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="heading heading--small ">ALT Attributes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes images don’t load and sometimes visually impaired users miss important information contained within images. This is solved by including ALT attributes in your image declarations. ALT attributes provide information about the content of images when images are disabled or unable to load.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The two main options for adding animation to your emails are Animated GIFs and CSS animation. Which one you choose to use depends on a number of factors including, email client support, accessibility needs, and your specific use case.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="heading heading--small ">Animated GIFs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Animated GIFs are a great way to add visual interest to your email and can be used to call attention to your primary message. While not all clients support animated GIFs, overall support is good. Keep in mind that GIFs are large files by nature - so it’s important to keep them short and use them sparingly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use cases for gifs: cinemagraphs, faking video, when you have a compelling image that would be improved with animation but requires no additional personalization or interaction.

                    <p>
                        CSS3 is a great alternative to animating your email content - without the added file size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use cases for css animation: when your animation requires interactivity (i.e. - shopping cart, product walkthrough, doing something on click or hover), animating personalized or live content, i.e. (twitter feed, animating a search form with the user's location, etc), basic interactions (i.e. - hover states, etc).
