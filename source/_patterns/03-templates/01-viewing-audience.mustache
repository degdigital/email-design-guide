				Most desktop clients utilize a small window to show a portion of the email on first load. This window is commonly referred to as the preview pane. Itâ€™s important to consider that although you are designing for a large screen, many readers will only see the beginning of your email. Consider designing your most interesting and engaging content higher in your email.
